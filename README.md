# odin_recipes

# Basic recipes HTML based project. It is first project of The Odin Projects curriculum.

# Here I need only HTML and more epecifically heading, paragraph, link and images that's it.

# This site will might not look beautiful because as we know by using HTML, we can only show or put the content on the web page but can't style it. In future we will return on this project once we will become familear with CSS and then we will style this project and will make it beautiful.
